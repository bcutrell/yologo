Next steps:

+ Clean up the view and controller logic by adding model methods that can account for user voting

+ Update the index page so that it includes a YOLOGO (the top rated logo) and an ONOLOGO (the worst rated logo), next to each logo should be the top rated comment for that logo

Yologo was developed by the following Launch Academy students:
